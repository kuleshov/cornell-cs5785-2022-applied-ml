# Applied Machine Learning (Cornell CS5785, Fall 2024)

This repo contains executable course notes and slides for the Applied ML course at Cornell and Cornell Tech (Fall 2024 edition).

Note that these notes are slightly different from the ones used in my Youtube [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcE9WGbi4QY&list=PL2UML_KCiC0UlY7iCQDSiGDMovaupqc83) videos from the Fall 2020 edition of the course. You may find these in my other Github repo.

## Contents

This repo is organized as follows.

```
.
├── README.md
├── slides                # Course slides
├── lecture-notes         # Lecture notes (expanding on the material in the slides)
└── requirements.txt      # Packages needed for your virtualenv
```

## Tentative Schedule
[PDFs of the slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-M6tNLGOMa4erAMj31jwmm-6m2MK0Prw?usp=sharing) —
please check back before the lectures as we will be updating the slides and PDFs throughout the semester.
